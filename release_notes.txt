RELEASE NOTES

Version 3.2
===========
Released May 27, 2014

- Color picker for FG and BG color also show a list of dominant colors in the image. 
    - This makes it more convenient to select plots.
    - In the future, the underlying algorithm will help improve automatic extraction.

- Bug fixes: The following issues have been fixed:
    - Under some screen resolutions, Firefox on Windows 7, would not show the zoom view or the sidebar buttons.
    - Clicking "Run" for auto detect without making a mask would throw an error in the javascript console.
        - Now, the entire image will be used by default if no mask is drawn.


Version 3.1
===========
Released: May 14, 2014

- Prevent browsers from caching HTML page of the app.


Version 3.0
===========
Released: May 11, 2014

A complete overhaul of the app was required to introduce some of the new features and improve maintainability.

Plot display:
    - Added ability to zoom in/out an image
    - Graphics widget can now handle relatively larger images

Zoom view:
    - Larger zoom view
    - Added ability to adjust magnification
    - Added ability to change crosshair color

Axes alignment:
    - Added ability to adjust points using keyboard keys. Pressing shift along with cursor keys moves the points faster.
    - Added labels for points which persist when alignment values are entered.
    - Unit can be defined for map axes. This is useful when making distance measurements.

Manual data acquisition:
    - Points can now be adjusted using keyboard cursor keys

Automatic data acquisition:
    - New mask display and color selection views improve overall detection accuracy.
    - Improved workflow eliminates the need for the popup window for fine tuning. These controls are now available from the sidebar itself.

Data table:
    - Digitized data can now be exported to a CSV file without the user having to copy-paste values.

Measurements:
    - Added ability to measure distances and angles in images. For map axes, the distances are calculated in the specified units.

Scripts:
    - Added preliminary support to allow custom user scripts

Webcam support:
    - Added webcam image capture ability (works only in Google Chrome or Firefox)

Image Editing:
    - Image editing functions (flip, crop etc.) have been temporarily hidden. These will be added back in the future releases.

Detection algorithms:
    - Only averaging window and X step are enabled in this version. Other algorithms will be included in a future release.

Code improvements:
    - New modular code structure improves maintainability and ease of adding new features
    - Noticeable performance improvements in many areas
    - More efficient use of memory

UI improvements:
    - Added button highlighting, cleaner stylesheets


Version 2.6
===========
Released: October 20, 2013

Handling Digitized Data:
	- Added option to graph or analyze data in Plot.ly (http://plot.ly)
	- Added options to sort data by ascending or descending order of variables
	- Added option to sort data by nearest neighboring data point. This is useful for things like sketches and outlines.

Automatic Data Extraction:
	- Added algorithm (only for XY plots) which allows user to control the X points at which the data is to be digitized. This is useful for digitizing and comparing values from two curves in the same plot (for example).

Support for Dates:
	- Dates can be entered for XY plots. While calibration, dates have to be entered in yyyy/mm or yyyy/mm/dd format. The output can be formatted in a variety of formats. Support for time is under consideration for next release.

Code improvements:
	- Several improvements in the javascript code were made to ensure WPD continues to work with new browsers.
	- Entire javascript is minified using the Closure compiler. This results in a significantly faster loading time for the app.
	- Minor performance improvements.
	- Minor clean up of the interface.

Browser Support:
	- WPD works in Internet Explorer 10 now.
	- Clipboard copy-paste works for Google Chrome.
