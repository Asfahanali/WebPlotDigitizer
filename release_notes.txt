RELEASE NOTES

Version 2.6
===========
Released: October 22, 2013 (Estimated)

Handling Digitized Data:
	- Added option to graph or analyze data in Plot.ly (http://plot.ly)
	- Added options to sort data by ascending or descending order of variables
	- Added option to sort data by nearest neighboring data point. This is useful for things like sketches and outlines.

Automatic Data Extraction:
	- Added algorithm (only for XY plots) which allows user to control the X points at which the data is to be digitized. This is useful for digitizing and comparing values from two curves in the same plot (for example).

Support for Dates:
	- Dates can be entered for XY plots. While calibration, dates have to be entered in yyyy/mm or yyyy/mm/dd format. The output can be formatted in a variety of formats. Support for time is under consideration for next release.

Code improvements:
	- Several improvements in the javascript code were made to ensure WPD continues to work with new browsers.
	- Entire javascript is minified using the Closure compiler. This results in a significantly faster loading time for the app.
	- Minor performance improvements.
	- Minor clean up of the interface.

Browser Support:
	- WPD works in Internet Explorer 10 now.
	- Clipboard copy-paste works for Google Chrome.
