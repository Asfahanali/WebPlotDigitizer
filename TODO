This is a brief TODO list for this project.

Features:

* Include ability to process bar codes.
* 3D plots.
* Circular particle or arbitrary shape recognition. Just calculate the location of the centroid of the shape.
* Upload images even in the absence of FileReader API (IE, Safari).

Bugs: 

* Deleting a specific point is off by a few pixels.
