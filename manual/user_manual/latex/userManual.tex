\section{Introduction}
A large quantity of useful data is available only in graphical form as plots in images. In these images, it is easy to determine the relationship between the variables involved, but recovering the exact numerical values of the data is usually a tedious and error prone process. To aid this time consuming task of data recovery, several digitization softwares have been developed over time. However, even with the abundance of free and commercial softwares, this task remains daunting and prone to errors. Many of the existing softwares are either design to work only on a specific operating system or work on only a small types of data. Some are difficult to use or prone to errors themselves, and many require a paid license which prevents their widespread use.

Because of these limitations of current digitizing softwares, WebPlotDigitizer was developed to facilitate easy and accurate data extraction from a variety of plot types and also maps. This program has been built using HTML5 which allows it to run within most popular web browsers and does not require an installation process that is performed by the user.

\subsection{User Manual}
This user manual describes the various capabilities of the software and explains the typical set of operations required to recover data from various common plot types.

\subsection{Supported Browsers}
Version 2.6 was ensured to work without major issues on the following browsers:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Safari 6.0.5 on Mac OS 10.8.5}
\item{Google Chrome on Max OS 10.8.5}
\item{Firefox on Windows 7 32-bit}
\item{Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 7 32-bit}
\item{Firefox on Xubuntu Linux}
\end{itemize}
It is expected that browsers similar in functionality and support for the HTML5 API should not have any major problems executing the version 2.6.
