Introduction

	WebPlotDigitizer is a HTML5 and JavaScript based tool to enable extraction
	of data from plot images. To retrieve data from a plot, just drag and drop
	the image on the plot area of the interface. You then have to specify the four
	corners of the axes to establish the coordinate system. Once the axes are
	specified, you can select points on the curves where you want the data.
	The program can convert the data into a Comma Separated Values (CSV) format
	which can be imported easily into most data analysis programs.  



Known Issues

	This is the first version of WebPlotDigitizer so there are a number of
	issues with the program. Some of these might be addressed to in the
	future.

	- Browser compatibility: This has been tested only on Firefox and Chrome.
	  Chrome works slightly better than Firefox. 

	- Zoom feature does not work when the mouse is 10 pixels from the border.

	- Drag and Drop feature does not test if the dropped file was a valid
	  image. Dropping a non-image file can potentially crash the browser.

	- Log scale axes don't seem to be supported, but you can still get the
	  exponent values if you specify the powers as the axis range. Ex: For log
	  scale X-axis ranging from 10^1 to 10^100, specify xmin as 1 and xmax as
	  100 and the X axis data will then be given by 10^{first column data}.

	- Screen resolution: Some display issues might arise on small screens as this
	  program has not been tested on low resolutions.

	- Offline Usage: getImageData() function in the JavaScript will throw a  
	  security error when this is used in offline mode in Firefox 3.6. 
	  Just select "remember" and "allow". This is just the javascript trying to
	  access the image file from your hard disk. Nothing malicious is going on here.
