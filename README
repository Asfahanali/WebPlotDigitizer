Introduction

	WebPlotDigitizer is a HTML5 and JavaScript based tool to enable extraction
	of data from plot images. To retrieve data from a plot, just drag and drop
	the image on the plot area of the interface. You then have to specify the four
	corners of the axes to establish the coordinate system. Once the axes are
	specified, you can select points on the curves where you want the data.
	The program can convert the data into a Comma Separated Values (CSV) format
	which can be imported easily into most data analysis programs.  

Version 2.0 Updates

	- User interface is slightly improved.
	- Basic image editing tools.
	- Automatic detection of plots. This feature is still experimental.
	- Support for polar and ternary plots.
	- Several minor additions.


Known Issues

	This is the first version of WebPlotDigitizer so there are a number of
	issues with the program. Some of these might be addressed to in the
	future.

	- Browser compatibility: This has been tested only on Firefox and Chrome.
	  Chrome works slightly better than Firefox. 

	- Offline Usage: getImageData() function in the JavaScript will throw a  
	  security error when this is used in offline mode in Firefox 3.6. 
	  Just select "remember" and "allow". This is just the javascript trying to
	  access the image file from your hard disk. Nothing malicious is going on here.
	  Offline mode does not work with Chrome. The best way to test this offline is to
	  host this on a local HTTP server.
